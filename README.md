# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Introduction
This analysis aimed at utilizing R programming. This was done by using statistical tests to analyze data from AutoRUs motor vehicle company. The aim of the data analyses was to help improve the overall efficiency of their manufacturing process.

## Deliverable 1
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
linear regression is a statistical model that is used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables fitted to the equation of a line. Multiple linear regression builds a linear regression model with two or more independent variables In this deliverable we chose to use the multiple linear regression beacuse we had a multiple number of avriables as our input. It is useful in quantifying the variablility of two correlated variables.

### Hypothesis
H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0

Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m â‰  0

To perform the linear regression, we utilized the lm() function and passed in all our six variables(vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance, AWD, and mpg) .
